QUESTION 1
CPU execution time can be useful for practical performance testing, but it is not reliable for measuring the theoretical efficiency of an algorithm. This is because it depends on hardware, operating system load, programming language, and compiler optimizations, rather than the algorithm itself.

QUESTION 2
1+1=2 O(1)

QUESTION 3
a) O(n)
b) O(n^2)
C) O(logn)
